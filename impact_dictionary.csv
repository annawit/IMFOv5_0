1,Acidification,"A measure of emissions that cause acidifying effects to the environment. The acidification potential is a measure of a molecule’s capacity to increase the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration in the presence of water, thus decreasing the pH value. Potential effects include fish mortality, forest decline and the deterioration of building materials.",kg SO2 equivalent,AP,"Bare, J.

2,Blue water consumption,"Blue water refers to surface and ground water only (excluding rain water, green water). Rain water is typically excluded from the assessment of freshwater consumption and this category focuses on blue water consumption only, as this is the relevant part which can be assessed with current impact assessment methods.    Water consumption is typically defined as ""water removed from, but not returned to the same drainage basin. Water consumption can be because of evaporation, transpiration, product integration or release into a different drainage basin or the sea. Evaporation from reservoirs is considered water consumption.""  In GaBi, this is calculated by  total blue water use (water input) – total blue water release back to watershed (degradative water outputs).
