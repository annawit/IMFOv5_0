# IMFOv5_0

A Shiny app to visualize the environmental impacts of materials.

## Usability

This app is best used with some instruction from the creators. This version had an embedded YouTube video which may be deleted or updated. It is recommended that future versions of the app should include text instruction, including intro tooltips, help tooltips, and supporting documentation to help users.

The colors in the app have not been optimized for differences in screen displays and are not colorblind friendly.

## Data

The mass data present in the app is dummy data intended to represent material weights as they are reported at the end of life in the state of Oregon, at various levels of aggregation.

The impact data is dummy data that represents realistic environmental impact factors that one would derive from a process-based life cycle analysis.

## Next steps

+ Structural changes: Redefine redundant logic, create functions, improve reactivity, remove hard-coding
+ Create internal links to glossary, FAQs
+ Introduce pre-sets to help user explore and compare maximum recovery, maximum disposal
+
