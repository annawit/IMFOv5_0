# IMFOv5_0

A Shiny app to visualize the environmental impacts of materials.

## Usability

This app is best used with some instruction from the creators. This version had an embedded YouTube video which may be deleted or updated. It is recommended that future versions of the app should include text instruction, including intro tooltips, help tooltips, and supporting documentation to help users.

The colors in the app have not been optimized for differences in screen displays and are not colorblind friendly.

## Data

The mass data present in the app is dummy data intended to represent material weights as they are reported at the end of life in the state of Oregon, at various levels of aggregation.

The impact data is dummy data that represents realistic environmental impact factors that one would derive from a process-based life cycle analysis.

## Next steps

+ Improve package version control
+ Add additional materials
+ Change reset toggle to button only
+ Create summary table that includes net impact, to be included on Visualize page
+ Structural changes: Redefine redundant logic, create functions, improve reactivity, remove hard-coding
+ Create internal links to glossary, FAQs
+ Introduce pre-sets to help user explore and compare maximum recovery, maximum disposal
+ Increase font sizes to improve usability
+ Anchor plotly legends so they don't overlap plots when window is resized
+ Improve glossary, make linked and searchable
+ Consider integrating the Impact Visualizer
+ Consider including tab where users can access all impact factors (and maybe mass) in a downloadable DT table
+ Incorporate "Oregon total" or other comparison bar on weight and impact plots, ideally that can be toggled on and off
<<<<<<< HEAD
+ Consider including different kinds of visualizations, such as scaleable icons
+ Work with target users to create best possible outputs, including plots and tables
+ Take some plotly tools off of plots for usability
